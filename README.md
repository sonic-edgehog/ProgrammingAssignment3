# ProgrammingAssignment3
A repository for Programming Assignment for Course 3 of R from John Hopkins University

As a assignment for cleaning and getting data from a source, the aim is to develop a script that cleans and saves the tidy dataset for further analysis.
The repository contains the following:
1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. A script that runs the analysis as described in the cookbook.

# Instructions
1. Download the run_analysis.R file to the R studio or R only.
2. Change the working directory to your preferred location.
3. Run the script using the Ctrl+R command or click the Run button.
4. Run the run_analysis.R file to get the tidyData.txt
